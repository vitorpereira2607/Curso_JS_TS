## Personal Objective
This repository is where I'll store my studies on JavaScript and its respective frameworks. My goal is to master this language and develop strong programming skills.

## Repository Structure
The files are organized by chapters from the course I'm following. Each chapter contains code examples, exercises, and practical projects.

## Progress and Activities
- [x] Completed: Chapter 1: Basic JavaScript
- [x] Completed: Chapter 2: JavaScript Programming Logics

## Future Expectations
I plan to apply what I've learned in this course both in personal projects and in the job market. Apart from solidifying my knowledge in JavaScript, I'm interested in exploring the following frameworks:
- React.js for building interactive interfaces
- Node.js for server-side application development
- Vue.js for building efficient web applications

I'm excited to start projects involving these frameworks and also contribute to open-source projects.
