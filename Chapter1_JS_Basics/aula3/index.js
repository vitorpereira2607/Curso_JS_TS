    In JavaScript, numbers are designated as a data type called "number." 
    Unlike some other programming languages, there isn't a distinction between different types of numbers in the way they are written.

//For instance:
console.log(2, 15.9); // In JavaScript, numbers are of the 'number' type. The '2' would be an integer (INT), and '15.9' would be a floating-point number (float).
